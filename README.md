Parallax Abstraction Layer
==========================

Language Agnostic API for P2 HAL Implementations

Introduction
------------

Wouldn't it be great if every (major/large) library for the Propeller 2 
implemented a similar API? Of course it would - then jumping from one language
to another would only be as hard as learning the new syntax rather than learning 
both a syntax and a new library API.

The Parallax Abstraction Layer aims to help make this happen by providing a
community-developed and language-agnostic API that hardware abstraction 
library (HAL) authors can use while implementing their designs.

There are two types of users for this repository: API designers and HAL 
authors. API designers will contribute their ideas to this repository and HAL
authors will take those ideas and turn them into executable code.
